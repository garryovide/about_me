      <h2>Welcome to the About Me</h2>
           <img class="imag_profile" src="images/socialpxhere.jpg"  alt="social-image" >
  		<p>My name is Garry Ovide.<br> I am currently working full-time at Hilton Hotel Newark Airport. Iâ€™ve been working there for almost seven years. I am working as a front desk supervisor. I am in charge of supervising day-to-day front desk activities. I ensure front desk tasks are done correctly and provide support to front desk employees. We provide customers with a first and last impression of our services as both greeters of new guests and well-wishers to the departing ones. Our motto is to make our guests feel comfortable away from home. One of my main responsibility includes completing operations checklists to complete daily tasks.</p>
      
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>In the mid-nineties, I have studied Electronics and Computer repair Networking. Presently, I am attending Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg NJ to get an associate degree in Interactive Media. I am planning to further my education by attending Rutgers to get my Bachelor after I graduate from RVCC. </p> 
      <p> I have worked as an electronic technician for Xerox in Boston Ma. I also worked for Manpower as a computer repair networking technician.</p>  
  		<p>Also, I want to be able to create my own website when I am done with the program. I wish to work for a big company after graduation for at least five
      years and open my own business.</p>
